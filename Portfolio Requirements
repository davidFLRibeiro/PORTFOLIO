head Line:
Hey, I´m David Ribeiro,


Intro: 
I´m recently graduate on Thinkfull Full stack Flex course. I´m 32 years old
and I´m a front-end and back-end developer.


About me:
programming for me began as an interest and has become a passion and there is nothing better than working on what we really enjoy. When I started doing the first projects, and in the end got a good result, there is nothing more satisfying as a programmer. 
I like to play computer games online FPS's or spend some time fishing or jut's relaxing on our beautiful sea.
